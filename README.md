# Lora-Tocsin
A Multidisciplinary IoT project undertaken at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, conducted in the fall of 2018.

The goal of the project is to design and build a IoT device that can send and receive sensor data utilizing LoRa.
The device should be able to function in Finnish outdoors climate for an extended period, acknowledging the seasonal changes.

The sensor should be able to function in areas that have limitations on internet access and power delivery. It 
should be designed to require no maintenance during its power cycle. The aim is to make the IoT device affordable so it can 
be deployed cheaply and if needed, in great numbers.

This repository contains the testing and the production codes for the project. The project progress can be viewed at the [project web page.]( http://www.erkinjuntti.eu/studies/lora-tocsin/)
